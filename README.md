A ReactJS application that was made mostly during the summer of 2021 as a
passion/learning project.

The app is easy to use, all the user has to do is pick a desired idea given
to them from a list of approx. ten ideas and wait for an ai to auto generate
the idea at hand for the user. If the user doesn't like the idea given to them
they always have the option to input their own ideas or refresh to get another
listing of ten more ideas to use. All the ideas are processed serverside via
DeepAI API, then an AI generates the idea and sends it back to the client.
This version of the application is clientside based (beyond DeepAI API
server calls made to generate the idea data (image/paragraph of text).
