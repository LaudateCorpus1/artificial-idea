---Artificial Idea---

![alt text](https://github.com/lichenstat/artificial-idea/blob/master/src/assets/logo512.png?raw=true)

A ReactJS application that was made mostly during the summer of 2021 as a 
passion/learning project.

The app is easy to use, all the user has to do is pick a desired idea given 
to them from a list of approx. ten ideas and wait for an ai to auto generate 
the idea at hand for the user. If the user doesn't like the idea given to them 
they always have the option to input their own ideas or refresh to get another 
listing of ten more ideas to use. All the ideas are processed serverside via 
DeepAI API, then an AI generates the idea and sends it back to the client.

This version of the application is purely clientside based (beyond DeepAI API
server calls made to generate the ideas)

If you wish build/use this application you will need your own DeepAI API key
